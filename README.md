The program is a simple console game inspired by the classic "Snake." The player controls the "snake's head" (represented by a red square) that moves across the screen. The objective is to collect obstacles (marked by the "*" symbol), which increase the score. The screen is surrounded by borders, and colliding with them or with yourself ends the game. The game dynamically updates the board, supports arrow-key controls, and displays the score in real time.

### Key Features:
1. **Game Board**: A console window with visible borders.
2. **Player Movement**: Controlled using arrow keys (up, down, left, right).
3. **Collisions**: 
   - With obstacles increase the score.
   - With walls or yourself end the game.
4. **Dynamic Obstacles**: After collecting an obstacle, a new one is generated at a random position.
5. **User Interface**: The score is displayed live.

The code provides basic but engaging game mechanics, making it ideal for learning programming and game logic in C#.
